## The deck is unlimited in size. 
## There are no jokers. 
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.

cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, 10, 10, 10]

def deal_card(rng): 
    """"Return random cards, the parameter rng is for set the range."""
    rnd_cards = []
    for i in range(rng): 
        rnd_cards.append(random.choice(cards))
    return rnd_cards

#Hint 5: Deal the user and computer 2 cards each using deal_card() and append().
user_cards = []
computer_cards = []

user_cards = deal_card(2)
print(f"Your Cards: {user_cards}")

computer_cards = deal_card(1)
print(f"Computer first Card: {computer_cards}")

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.

def calculate_score(cards):
    """"Return the score of the game."""
    score = 0
    card_str = str(cards)
    if 11 in cards and 10 in cards:
        print("BlackJack")
        score = 0
        return "You Win!!"
    else:
        for i in range(len(cards)):
                score += cards[i]
        if score >= 21:
            cards.remove(cards[0])
            cards.insert(0, 11)
            print(f"You scored: {score}\nGame Over, You lose!!")
            return "You Lose!!"
    return score
# print(calculate_score(user_cards))
# print(calculate_score(computer_cards))

print(calculate_score(user_cards))


#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.

#Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().

#Hint 9: Call calculate_score(). If the computer or the user has a blackjack (0) or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.

#Hint 10: If the game has not ended, ask the user if they want to draw another card. If yes, then use the deal_card() function to add another card to the user_cards List. If no, then the game has ended.

#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.

#Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

#Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
